Error 1
ImportError: cannot import name 'izip' from 'itertools' 
If you're runnning the file in python3, you don't need to import
Also,within your code, change izip to zip() and that should solve your error

Error 2
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dateutil'
Run the following command on my environment(VS Code) terminal:
pip install python-dateutil

Error 3
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'BaseHTTPServer'
change this to :from http.server import
Again python version changes

Error 4
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'SocketServer'
For python3 this should be written as socketserver

Error 5
AttributeError: 'generator' object has no attribute 'next'
For python3, next is written as __next__

Error 6
_csv.Error: iterator should return strings, not bytes (the file should be opened
 in text mode)
To the line of code referenced in the error, change "rb" to "r" and this will solve the error.

Having solved the above error, I was able to solve the errors in the server.py file
